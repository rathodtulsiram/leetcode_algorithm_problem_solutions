# [Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

Given two strings **s** and **t** which consist of only lowercase letters.

String **t** is generated by random shuffling string **s** and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in **t**.

Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```
# Solution
```
/**
* @return char
*/
fun findTheDifference(s: String, t: String): Char {
    val charArray = s.toCharArray()
    val shuffledCharList = t.toCharArray().toMutableList()
    for (index in 0 until charArray.size) {
        shuffledCharList.remove(charArray[index])
    }
    return shuffledCharList[shuffledCharList.size - 1]
}

```
